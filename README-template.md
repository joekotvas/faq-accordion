# Frontend Mentor - FAQ accordion solution

This is a solution to the [FAQ accordion challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/faq-accordion-wyfFdeBwBz). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects. 

My challenge for this project was to build out this faq accordion component and get it looking as close to the design as possible in only 30 minutes. 

I was able to complete the component in vanilla HTML and CSS in just 44 minutes. Pretty close! In that time, I made sure the component was fully responsive and  accessible to keyboard users, including on-brand colors for the keyboard focus ring, etc.

I took another 5 minutes to create this readme and deploy the site to Netlify.
